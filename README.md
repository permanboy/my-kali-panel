## About Panel Profiles

Panel profiles are pre-configured settings files that allow you to quickly switch between different configurations for panels. They typically include settings related to appearance, layout, shortcuts, extensions, and other customization options. By using panel profiles, you can streamline your workflow and have different configurations tailored to specific tasks or projects.

In this repository, you will find configuration files for various panels, such as:

- [Panel 1](./panel1.md): Configuration file for Panel 1.
- [Panel 2](./panel2.md): Configuration file for Panel 2.
- [Panel 3](./panel3.md): Configuration file for Panel 3.

Feel free to explore and download the configuration files that interest you.
